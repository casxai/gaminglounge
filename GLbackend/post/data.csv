b5_qwert1,"Personally, I think she is quite underwhelming compared to the rest of the fighters. Especially in the current meta

Initiation/tankiness/spell vamp are what makes the fighters viable in the current meta and she falls short on all 3 categories. There are alot of heroes better than her in every aspect

She isn't quite tanky and can be bursted down She is a single target hero so she can't initiate properly She is so weak against cc compositions and most top tier tanks and fighters now are cc dependent

Not to mention that once the enemy gets anti heal, she is quite easy to deal with even in a 1v1 fight. I remember killing a lot of cecis using a war axe+ dom ice arlott

Side tilt: a basic swing forward with spear.

Downward tilt: poke downward with short sword.

Upward tilt: a single spin with club above head (like in totk).

Side smash: slow swing forward with heavy club (like from botw).

Upward smash: muti-hit swing with spear above head (like from aoc botw and totk).

Downward smash: hits ground with heavy club creating shock wave.

Neutral tilt: three hit combo with club (like from botw and totk)

Not sure what air attacks will be since they never go into the air.

Downward special: counter (like from skyward sword)

Forward special: throws hammer forward (like from aoc)

Upward special: idk

Normal special: bow

b5_qwertll,"I know it's a very childish question but I'm all out of options. I've played through the all of the current archon quests, tons of world quests, always out of resin, and I can't bring myself to go and just farm. My exploration progress is at point where it's more walking than actual exploration. And since school hasn't started again, even during the school year, I'm bored out of my mind.

So, I would like to make the request for someone I can regularly play Genshin with. Even if it's like, once or twice a week, that would get me through the rest of the school year with ease. I just don't have anyone irl to play with.

I know this will probably be ingnored or taken down but a shot not taken is a guaranteed miss.
